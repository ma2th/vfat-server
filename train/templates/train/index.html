<h3 class="pb-3">Improvable Regions</h3>

{% if left or right %}

<p/>
    The following images show exemplary training positions (marked with an <b>x</b>)
    during a training session in the smartphone app.
    The positions are selected randomly for each training session but with
    higher probability in the more <q>blue-ish</q> regions and lower probability
    in the more <q>green-ish</q> regions.
</p>
<p>
    The colors correspond to the result of your most recent equidistant assessment. The color is
    more blue if brighter stimuli had to be presented in order to be perceivable and
    it is more green if the darker stimuli were perceived.
</p>
<p>
    The number of training positions (50 in the example below), thresholds of the training stimuli,
    and other parameters can be configured in the
    <a href="{% url 'clientconf:index' %}">app settings</a>.
